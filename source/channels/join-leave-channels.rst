Join and Leave Channels
=======================

Join a channel
--------------

To join a public channel, select the **+** symbol at the top of the channel sidebar, then select **Browse Channels**. Search through the list of public channels you can join, then select **Join**.

To join a private channel, you need to be added to the channel by a member of that channel.

Leave a channel
---------------

Select the channel name at the top of the center pane to access the drop-down menu, then select **Leave Channel**. 

Any team member who leaves a private channel must be re-added by another channel member if they wish to rejoin. Team members will not receive mention notifications from channels of which they are not members.
