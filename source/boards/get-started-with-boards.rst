Create a board
--------------

When you first start using Boards, you need to create a board. You can select a template from the options provided or you can create an empty board. The only difference is that a template will be populated with sample cards and properties and in an empty template you start from scratch.

Each board is linked to the channel it was created in. 

Create a card

Cards are like sticky notes. You can arrange them in various ways, using different views. You can also give them mutiple areas of information called properties. Adding and using properties makes it easier to organize and find cards, using filters based on card properties.

Cards are populated using the Description field, and you can use Markdown to add formatting. You can add comments to a card in the Comments section.

Select an existing card to open it or create a new card.

Properties are displayed on the card when you open it, and you can also choose to display your cards based on their properties.

Properties can be renamed and deleted.
