Get Started with Mattermost Channels
====================================
Access Mattermost Channels by selecting **Channels** from the [product list].

Channels are where you can communicate with your team about various topics or projects. 
Channels and channel management tools are available in the channel sidebar to the left. 

See [XXX] for details on the many ways you can use Channels to enable team collaboration.

Channels and direct messages
----------------------------

Everyone who joins a Mattermost workspace is automatically added to two default channels: **Town Square** and **Off-Topic**. 

- **Town Square** is great for your team-wide communications, such as announcements.
- **Off-Topic** is great for fun, social, non-work-related conversations. 

Direct messages are private conversations between two people. 
Group messages are private conversations for small groups of up to seven people. 
Start a new direct or group message by selecting **+** next to **Direct Messages** in the channel sidebar.

.. tip:: 
    Direct and group messages are also channels in Mattermost, so many of the [preferences available for channels] are also available for direct messages. 

Create and join channels
------------------------

Channels are either **public** or **private**.

- **Public** channels are identified with a [globe] **Globe** icon. Anyone on the team can join a public channel.
- **Private** channels are typically used for sensitive topics, and are identified with a [lock] **Lock** icon. You must be invited to private channels by another channel member.  

To see all available public channels you can join, select **+** at the top of the channel sidebar, then select **Browse Channels**. Search for channels by name or scroll through the list. Select **Join** next to any channel to become a member of that channel.

.. tip:: 
    Select **Find Channel** in the channel sidebar to see all of the channels you're currently a member of across all of your teams, including public and private channels, as well as all direct and group messages.

To create a new public or private channel, select **+**, then select **Create New Channel**. Anyone can create new channels, unless the System Admin has [restricted permissions] to do so. See [XXX] for more information on creating channels.

As your channel sidebar fills up with channels you've joined, you can organize your channels into categories based on how you work. See [XXX] for information on customizing your channel sidebar.

Invite people to the team
-------------------------

You can invite members of your organization, as well as external guests such as vendors or project partners, to a Mattermost team. Anyone can invite people to the team, unless the System Admin has [disabled this option] or [restricted permissions] to do so. 

To invite people to a team, select **+**, then select **Invite People**. 

- For existing Mattermost users, enter usernames, then select **Member**. An invitation to join the team is sent as a direct message.
- For new Mattermost users or guests, enter email addresses, then select **Guest**. You must specify the channels the guest can access. 

.. tip:: 
    To extend an invitation to a larger group of people, you can share a team invitation link rather than sending individual invitations. Select **+**, then select **Invite People**, then copy the invite link to your clipboard.

All email invitations contain a single-use link that expires after 48 hours. System Admins can also [invalidate all active invitation links]. See [XXX] for more information on inviting people to your Mattermost workspace.

Send messages
-------------

Enter your message in the text field, then press ENTER to send the message. Your messages can also include images and file attachments.

- Copy and paste images or drag-and-drop image files into the text field to add them to your message.
- Select the [Attachment] icon to the right of the text field to attach documents or other files to your message.

Customize your Mattermost experience
------------------------------------

You can customize many aspects of your Mattermost experience, including the types of notifications you receive, how unread channels are organized, the number of direct messages to show, your Mattermost theme, and more!

- Select your user avatar in the top-right corner of the Mattermost screen to manage your profile, status, and availability. See [XXX] for more information on managing your profile.
- Select the [Settings] icon to manage your notifications, display, channel sidebar options, and more. See [XXX] for more information on managing your Mattermost preferences.
